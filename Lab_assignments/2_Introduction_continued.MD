## Lab 2: Introduction to programming continued 

Today we will be continuing to learn about introduction to programming for biologists. We will focus on some basic, but very useful information such as paths, the path, variables,  and conditionals. The examples I'm giving you are for a bash Linux system, but the ideas behind these are generally true for programming languages at large (although the syntax will be different).

### Paths

**EDIT ME**
Related to the above, any file/location can be specified relative to your current working directory (folder). So for example if I'm in the gen711 folder from the above example, I can point to the exam 1 key with exam1_key.txt. If I am in the stuckert/ directory, I can point to the same file with gen711/exam1_key.txt. Alternatively, I can use the absolute path, which specifies the full path to a file. In this case, I can use /home/stuckert/gen711/exam1_key.txt to point to this exam key no matter what directory I am currently in.

### Variables 

Variables are an incredibly useful programming tool. I personally use them a lot, possibly excessively. They are particularly useful for calling paths, scripts, or specifying output, etc. They are frequently used in scripts, and are frequently defined based on input when you call a script.
