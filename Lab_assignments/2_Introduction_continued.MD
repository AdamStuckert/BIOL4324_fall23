## Lab 2: Introduction to programming continued 

Today we will be continuing to learn about introduction to programming for biologists. We will focus on conditionals and scripts to start. Again, the examples I'm giving you are for a bash Linux system, but the ideas behind these are generally true for programming languages at large (although the syntax will be different).


## Conditionals

Conditionals are a programming staple. There are three main types that we will cover in class:

1. For loops
2. While loops
3. If then statements

Each of these have their own unique uses in programming, and programming languages all have their own
For loops are meant to run through every item in a list and do a series of tasks.


## Scripts
