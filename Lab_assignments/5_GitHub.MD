### Lab 5: intro to GitHub

We will be following the tutorial here: https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners. This tutorial is very good, and there is no sense in recreating the wheel. Instead, I will just be asking for a few screenshots along the way. 

One major note here, do all of this through Opuntia instead of your computer. This also means you do not have to install git--it is already installed there. Another side effect of this is that you will have to continually type your GitHub username and password--this is related to permissions and security on Ron.

1. What is the full path to the location of git on Opuntia?
2. Post a screenshot of your newly minted GitHub account (if you already had one for some other purpose that is obviously fine, but still post a screenshot).
3. Post a screenshot of your newly initiated repo (the first one via the command line).
4. Post a screenshot of your first commit.
5. Post a screenshot of your newly initiated repo (the second one you did via the GitHub website). Hint: the green new repo button seems to be in the top left of the main GitHub page now.

Step 5 note: The command `git checkout -b <my branch name>` can be used to either 1) create a new branch (as you used it) or 2) to switch to that branch and examine it via `git checkout <my branch name>`.

Step 6 hint: you can copy the code you need via the button to the right of **..or push an existing repository from the command line**

Before Step 7: Add a new file to the second branch (the one you manually created) before you push your new branch. You will have to then `add` and `commit` this file before pushing it. Review the stuff you've already done to remember how to do this!

6. Post a screenshot of your submitted Pull Request.
7. Post a screenshot of your git log.
