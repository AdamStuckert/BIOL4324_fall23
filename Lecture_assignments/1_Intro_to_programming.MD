# Intro to terminal and Unix

One of the most fundamental parts of bioinformatics is a basic familiarity with the command line. Many things are Linux and bash based, so these are good skills to develop. 

### Basic Unix rules

* Everything is case sensitive. BIOL4324 is not the same as biol4324.

* Unlike a GUI interface to view files on your personal computer, once you delete something it is **permanently gone**. You can easily delete an entire hard drive's worth of data by accident in seconds. I call this "pulling a Newhouse." A friend of mine did this to a hard drive in his lab, and there was much swearing.

* Related to the above, there is no undo button. If you write over a file or make a change to it, the deed is done and cannot be undone.

* The two points above are a very good reason why you should 1) be extremely careful when in terminal and 2) maintain good backup copies of all data outside of the environment you are working in! It is unreasonably easy to delete months and thousands of dollars worth of work.

* Spaces in file names should be avoided. Spaces are a special character (represented as `\s`) and thus make things wacky. 

* Your `$PATH` is the collection of locations where the computer looks for executables (programs).

* Folders and Files are all you have. If you want to access one of these, you need to tell the computer EXACTLY where it is. 
`/home/stuckert/biol4324/exam1_key.txt` will work (assuming you’ve spelled things correctly, and that the file really exists in that location), but `exam1_key.txt` may not.

* Related to the above, any file/location can be specified relative to your current working directory (folder). So for example if I'm in the `biol4324` folder from the above example, I can point to the exam 1 key with `exam1_key.txt`. If I am in the `stuckert/` directory, I can point to the same file with `biol4324/exam1_key.txt`. Alternatively, I can use the *absolute path*, which specifies the full path to a file. In this case, I can use `/home/stuckert/biol4324/exam1_key.txt` to point to this exam key *no matter what directory I am currently in*.

* In this document, as in scripts generally, lines that begin with a `#` are comments and are not run.


##### Mac users
* Unix shell: Terminal, which is pre-installed on MacOSX. You can find it through the Finder by going to Go-> Utilities-> Terminal.

##### Windows users
* PuTTY: A terminal which you can install from [the putty website](https://www.putty.org/)
* MobaXterm: A terminal which you can install from [the MobaXterm website](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
*Built in Linux subsystem in Windows

Once you have these installed, we can access your Ron account and get you rolling! 

**BEFORE WE DO THIS, A CRITICAL NOTE:**

If you are on a Mac and working through the terminal, or on a PC an working through MobaXterm, once you open the terminal you are **working in your computer's directories**. This means that you can accidentally delete/corrupt files on your personal computer, **including your operating system.** Please be extremely careful. I am not responsible for any personal sorrow you suffer in this manner.



### Basic commands
* `pwd` print working directory
* `ls` list directory contents
* `nano` open up a text editor
* `mkdir` make a directory (folder)
* `cd` Change directories
* `rm` delete a file
* `mv` move a file
* `cp` copy a file
* `man` gives information about a program. This is very useful.

### Practice some basic commands

This section is your `homework` for the day. You can (and should) get details on these commands using `man` as you go so that you can learn their uses. 

1. What does this command do? 

```bash
pwd
```

Learn more using `man pwd`.

2. The `ls` command lists files and folders in your present directory. Try both `ls -lt` and `ls -lht`. What is the difference between these commands. 

3. Create a new directory named `first_dir`. What command did you use to do this?

4. Next we will move into your new directory. What command would you use to do this?

5. Now we will create a new file using a text editor called `nano`. Typing the nano command opens up the editor. I want you to save the following as your file text. In order to do this copy it from this page and paste it in to `nano` using a right click. 

```
Hello world!
This is my first ever text file.
It has a number of words.
And a number of lines.
It is pretty neat.
But a bird in a tree is better
```

Once you have pasted this in, save it as `firstfile.txt`:

```bash
ctrl + x / cmnd + x # to close
y  # y to save edits, n to exit without saving edits
firstfile.txt # whatever you type here will be the file name
```

6. What if you forgot what was in this file, or this is a file that someone else gave you and you had no idea what it was? There are a variety of ways to view files. Try `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, and `more`. For each of these you have to specify the filename second (e.g., ` cat firstfile.txt`). What is the difference between `cat` and `head`?

7. Make a copy of your file, then remove the original.

```bash
cp firstfile.txt 2ndfile.txt # make copy
ls -lht # view contents of your directory to see new file
rm firstfile.txt # remove original
ls -lht
```

Now try moving the file.

```bash
mv 2ndfile.txt firstfile.txt
```

What is the difference between `cp` and `mv`?

8. We did quite a lot today! Try using `history` to see all the commands you typed today.

For more information on some of these commands, and to learn some new and useful ones, take a look at [this website](http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-08-21-upenn/novice/ref/01-shell.html).
